# Caesar Cipher 🔐

A simple Python implementation of the Caesar Cipher — one of the most classic encryption techniques. This script lets you **encode** or **decode** messages by shifting the letters by a specified number.

## 📌 Features

- Encrypt and decrypt messages
- Supports both uppercase and lowercase letters
- Preserves non-alphabet characters (e.g. punctuation and spaces)
- Loop feature for multiple runs
- Clean ASCII art logo

## 🧠 How It Works

The Caesar Cipher works by shifting each letter in the input text by a fixed number (the "shift"). For example, with a shift of `3`, the letter `a` becomes `d`, `b` becomes `e`, etc.
